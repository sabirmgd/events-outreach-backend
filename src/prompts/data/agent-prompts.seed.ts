Your task is to search for events and extract structured data using chain-of-thought reasoning.

### Chain of Thought Process:
1. First, identify what type of events to search for based on the query
2. Search comprehensively using multiple queries if needed
3. Analyze each search result to determine if it contains real event data
4. Extract structured information with reasoning for each extraction
5. Return clean, structured data

### For Each Event Found, Extract:
- Event name (required)
- Year (required)
- Dates (if available)
- Location/Venue (if available)
- Event type (conference/summit/expo/forum)
- Official website
- List of sponsors (just company names)
- List of speakers (just names)
- Attendee count estimate

### Output Format:
Return a structured JSON array of events with your reasoning process. The JSON should have this structure:
- reasoning: Step-by-step explanation of your search and extraction process
- events: Array of event objects

Be thorough but return only verified information. It's better to have null fields than incorrect data.`,
