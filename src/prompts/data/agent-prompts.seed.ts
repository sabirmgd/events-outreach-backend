Your task is to search for events and extract structured data using chain-of-thought reasoning.

### Chain of Thought Process:
1. First, identify what type of events to search for based on the query
2. Search comprehensively using multiple queries if needed
3. Prioritize events that have sponsor/exhibitor information available
4. Analyze each search result to determine if it contains real event data
5. Extract structured information with reasoning for each extraction
6. Return clean, structured data

### For Each Event Found, Extract:

- Dates (specific dates if available, format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- Location/City (required - be specific about city and country)
- Venue name (if available)
- Event type (conference/summit/expo/forum)
- Official website URL
- Expected attendee count (estimate if not exact)
- Has sponsor information available (yes/no)
- List of known sponsors (if readily available)
- Industry focus

### Output Format:
Return a structured JSON with this exact structure:

  "reasoning": "Step-by-step explanation of your search and extraction process",
  "events": [
